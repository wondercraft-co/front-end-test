The goal of this task is to test your FrontEnd skills in an agency type of project.

The rules
- You should not need any FE library to

### The Designs
You can find the designs in this url: https://scene.zeplin.io/project/5e1ab424f523ba7ad53ff01f
This is a fictitious Coffee Store and you'll have to create the HTML, CSS and JS necessary to build it.
The whole design uses only 2 fonts Karla and Lara both of which you can find in google fonts

### The Sections
There are 5 sections/modules in the homepage and each has some specific instructions:

### The header
The assets for the header can be found 

### The hero.
There is a very important requirement for the hero: The image has to be responsive (hint: srcset)

### The product grid.
For this section you need to fetch a json products array from https://api.jsonbin.io/b/5e1aa891b236b871b3605dd6 and based on the information in there render the grid.
You can use any library or framework to do this part. Bonus point if you do it with your own JS or jQuery - this is too easy with React, Vue or Angular.
- You need to order the list alphabetically by name

### The newsletter signup

### The footer

### The modal
Its very important that you don't use any JS library for this module besides jQuery. the challenge is to build a modal yourself:
- The modal opens when you click //TODO add button
- The backdrop can close the modal.
- Both Cancel and Proceed just close the modal too.
- In the mobile view. Make sure the content of the modal can be scrolled and the buttons remain visible/fixed to the footer of the modal.
