Hi dear developer,

First of all, thank you **VERY much** for taking the time to do this test. We value your time and appreciate you for spending that precious resource on this.

## 🙇‍♂️ Introduction
The goal of this task is to test your Front-End skills in an agency type of project.

One of the most important things when working in these types of projects is that **you can *read* and follow instructions precisely.** So make sure you read this document thoroughly.

You are welcome to ask your reviewer **any** questions you want, after all, that is very encouraged in our company.

## 🏆 The Goal
Your job is to recreate the homepage of a fictitious Coffee Store using HTML, CSS and JS. You should complete the build following the below assets, specs and requirements. Good luck and enjoy!

## 🖍 The Design
* You can find the designs in [this link](https://scene.zeplin.io/project/5e1ab424f523ba7ad53ff01f). Or if you prefer, we can give you access to the Zeplin project, that can certainly make spacing and font sizing easier. 

* The whole design uses only 2 fonts Karla and Lara, both of which you can find in google fonts.
* The assets necessary are in the folder `/assets` of this repository.

## ⚔️ The Sections
There are 5 sections/modules on the homepage, and each has some specific instructions:

**1 .The header:** Pretty standard not much to explain here.

**2 .The hero:** You know how important it is to optimize images to load smaller assets depending on the device. So there is an essential requirement for the hero; the image has to be responsive (hint: srcset + object-fit)

**3. The product grid:** No lets get interesting. For this section, you need to fetch the products data from this endpoint via ajax.

* You can use only vanilla JS or jQuery for this task. Please do not use React, Vue, or Angular; it's too easy.
* You need to order the list alphabetically by name.
* Use this section to shine. If you want to add some entry animations, go ahead. If you want to add a loading state, please do.
* As you will see in the JSON, the price is in cents: 12350 is equal $12.35

**4. The newsletter sign-up:** Not much to explain here; make sure it works on mobile too.

**5.The footer:** It's just a footer.

**6. The modal:** For this module, you must **NOT** use any JS library besides jQuery. the challenge is to build a modal yourself:

* The modal opens when you click on the fixed button, the one with the  orange background and the comment icon.
* The backdrop should close the modal.
* Both Cancel and Proceed should close the modal too.
* On mobile, make sure the content is scrollable, and buttons always remain visible regardless of the length of the content.

## 🌈 Notes on CSS and build systems
* You can use any preprocessor of your preference.
* You can use any CSS framework you want, but I encourage you to use it sparingly, remember we are trying to see how you work through problems and how you propose solutions.
* You can use any build system or no build system at all.

## 💎 The deliverable: What you need to submit
We are expecting either: 
1. A github repository: This one is better because it tells us a little bit about how you use and know Git. This also helps us see the code easier.
2. A .zip file with the code.
